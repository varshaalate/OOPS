# OOPS
 A collection of basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and code examples created during my learning journey. Covers core principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction with simple implementations for practice and understanding.



 Encapsulation : 
    Binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference
